# Console Shape Application Project
This C++ project is designed to handle geometric shapes, including Rectangle, Triangle, and Circle. The project follows a modular structure with separate header (.h) and implementation (.cpp) files for each class.
## Folder Structure
The project is organized into the following folders:

- **include**: Contains header files for each geometric shape class.
 
- **src**: Contains implementation files corresponding to each header file.
 
- **main.cpp**: Main source file where the program execution starts.
##  1. Rectangle
 
- Header: include/Rectangle.h
 
- Implementation: src/Rectangle.cpp
 
## 2. Triangle
 
Header: include/Triangle.h
 
Implementation: src/Triangle.cpp
 
## 3. Circle
 
Header: include/Circle.h
 
Implementation: src/Circle.cpp

## Building and Running
